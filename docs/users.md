## Phi Protocol has 5 key types of users:

- Credential Creator
- Curator
- Verifier
- Artist
- Minter/Collector

---

- Credential Creator Credential Creators can suggest/create an Onchain credential by indexing blockchain data.

- Curator Curators show support for specific credentials by buying or selling Shares. Purchasing Shares helps the
  protocol understand which credentials are in higher demand. This is defined by the bonding curve for each Credential
  along with how early the Curator bought their share.

  Curators also earn a portion of mint fees for the credentials

- Verifier Verifier's help create the logical criteria to verify that the Minter is eligible to claim a credential by
  querying the user's onchain data. Verifier's achieve this by creating the backend validation logic and hosting this
  for Phi Protocol.

  Verifier's also earn a portion of mint fees for the credential they help verify.

- Artist Artists help create credential content which can be minted by Minters who want to collect the credentials.
  Multiple artists and artworks can be created for an onchain credential, which allows various styles of art to be
  collected. Artist's also earn a portion of mint fees for the credential they help verify.

- Collector Collectors focus on meeting eligibility requirements to collect Credentials. Collectors mint Credential
  NFT's and pay a small fee in the process.
