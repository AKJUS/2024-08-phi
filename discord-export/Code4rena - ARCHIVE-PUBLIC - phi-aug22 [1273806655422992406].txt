this should be obvious to most people, but just to make sure it would be user friendly for starters. the git 2024-08-phi command should be cd 2024-08-phi instead

i also had this in another contest and they told me to do some installation, but im not sure what to do here


[08/24/2024 14:46] .justuzair
probably an issue related to remapping


[08/24/2024 14:46] .justuzair
not sure tho


[08/24/2024 14:48] .justuzair
make sure that you have installed the packages correctly


[08/24/2024 14:48] .justuzair
refer to the readme file for the steps


[08/24/2024 14:48] valenz1
okay


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
im not sure what this means


[08/24/2024 14:51] 0xsorrynotsorry
it seems like the path is referred by an incorrect slash `\` should be  `/` in @prb/test\src/PRBTest.sol ?


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
yeah


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
but like how to fix it


[08/24/2024 14:51] .justuzair
how did you install foundry and all the other packages??


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
forge install?


[08/24/2024 14:51] .justuzair
```
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi.git
git 2024-08-phi
git submodule update --init --recursive
bun install
forge test -vvv
```


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
i just did whatever that was told in the readme


[08/24/2024 14:51] valenz1
yea


[08/24/2024 14:52] valenz1
i cant do bun


[08/24/2024 14:52] .justuzair
Try this @Valenz


[08/24/2024 14:52] .justuzair
use npm


[08/24/2024 14:52] valenz1

[08/24/2024 14:52] .justuzair
you can also run bun if you are using wsl


[08/24/2024 14:52] valenz1
im not using wsl


[08/24/2024 14:52] .justuzair
you are missing nodejs, hence missing npm


[08/24/2024 14:52] .justuzair
then you can use npm, search the internet on how to install npm


[08/24/2024 14:53] .justuzair
you can either install nodejs directly or use nvs (node versioning system) for npm

you can manually correct the slash


[08/24/2024 14:54] valenz1
ok thx


[08/24/2024 14:54] valenz1
where


[08/24/2024 14:59] .justuzair
i think your issue should be solved if you install everything correctly


[08/24/2024 14:59] .justuzair
i just cloned and tested the repo today morning


[08/24/2024 15:19] codecop_
@Docs Wolf 
when I mint an art, i call claim() inside PhiFactory, internally during state updates, the credMinted and artMinted state gets updated.
artMinted makes sense, why do we have credMitnted? 
Do we mint cred?


[08/24/2024 15:38] valenz1
r u a windows user


[08/24/2024 15:40] waydoum
the slash problem is normal cause you're a windows user, when you get this error you either need to fix your remappings or install what's missing


[08/24/2024 15:41] waydoum
did you install node_modules ?


[08/24/2024 15:44] valenz1
nope


[08/24/2024 15:44] valenz1
is it the node js thing?


[08/24/2024 15:45] waydoum
dude just run bun install and it'll fix


[08/24/2024 15:45] valenz1
i cant run bun install


[08/24/2024 15:45] waydoum
install what's missing you can't expect it to work


[08/24/2024 15:45] waydoum
why not ?


[08/24/2024 15:45] valenz1
yea but what is it?


[08/24/2024 15:46] valenz1
what makes bun unable to be run


[08/24/2024 15:46] waydoum
what's the error, I'm pretty sure you just need to search for it online


[08/24/2024 15:47] valenz1
.


[08/24/2024 15:47] waydoum
I'm talking about bun install what's the error


[08/24/2024 15:48] codecop_
did you use bun to installl the dependencies?

you need to follow the instructuions, without bun install it won't work


[08/24/2024 15:49] codecop_
delete the caches and node modules and runn `bun install`


[08/24/2024 15:49] waydoum

this should solve @Valenz


[08/24/2024 15:50] valenz1
where is it


[08/24/2024 15:50] valenz1
wait lemme search


[08/24/2024 15:51] codecop_
delete lib folder, node modules folder


[08/24/2024 15:51] codecop_
you should find it in the root directory already


[08/24/2024 15:52] valenz1
there is no node modules


[08/24/2024 15:53] codecop_
see you can find node_modules folder in the path: 2024-08-phi/node_modules


[08/24/2024 15:54] codecop_
also you should have bun installed, if you don't have refer to google and install bun


[08/24/2024 15:54] .justuzair
yessur


[08/24/2024 15:54] .justuzair
bro install nodejs, it has npm installed, instead of bun use npm

[08/24/2024 15:55] .justuzair

[08/24/2024 15:55] .justuzair

[08/24/2024 15:55] valenz1
yea i was just listening to him


[08/24/2024 15:55] valenz1
im trying to install, but uh

for your last question to the bot ERC1155 have one contract who got all nfts not every nft has it's own address


[08/24/2024 16:17] codecop_
so that means that when i create a new art inside a cred which already has an art, i won't be technically creating a new NFT?


[08/24/2024 16:17] codecop_
not unique then i suppose


[08/24/2024 16:18] waydoum
The distinctive feature of ERC1155 is that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once. This is why its balanceOf function differs from ERC20‚Äôs and ERC777‚Äôs: it has an additional id argument for the identifier of the token that you want to query the balance of.


[08/24/2024 16:19] codecop_
Oh i see, didn't have much background of ERC1155 so got stuck here. I thought that just like ERC721 it deploys a new contract whenever an art is created. Thanks @Waydou

Who determines the maxPrice when a share is bought? It is given as input as i can see. How does it vary with the actual price each time a share is bought?

Started a thread.


[08/25/2024 07:45] waydoum
this is the maxPrice the buying person is willing to pay, it's for slippage protection I feel

I may be wrong, I would love if the team can clarify


[08/25/2024 07:46] villy9172
Yeah, front running with large amounts to change the price of the shares, that's why projects use max and min price

is there any difference between Creator and Artist?


[08/25/2024 09:12] villy9172
Creator is the one which is initiating the indexing of blockchain data to be made into a credential, the artist is the only creating the art, both combined create the unique nft as far as I understand

[08/25/2024 09:23] villy9172

What is the purpose of the SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD?


[08/30/2024 14:23] mctoady
Believe it is essentially a flash loan protection, to stop someone buying then selling a share in the same block


[08/30/2024 14:25] izuman
Ah, I am just wondering why they would need protection against that.


[08/30/2024 14:36] mctoady
I believe in the original audit report it was pointed out a user could buy cred shares/claim the curator rewards/then sell in one tx, this makes that less appealing as they have to hold onto the cred shares for at least 10 minutes


[08/30/2024 14:37] izuman
Thanks for the reply, I need to read the previous audits.

[08/31/2024 11:58] nikolap2015
You need to send eth, equal to the price of the first share

@Docs Wolf What is soul bounded?


[08/31/2024 14:27] waydoum
souldbound is to see of the minted nfts are transferable or no


[08/31/2024 14:27] waydoum
they're just ERC1155

Is it correct to assume that the `signedData_` parameter in `Cred.createCred`, `Cred.updateCred` and `PhiFactory.createArt` is always trusted (checked on the backend) and any bugs caused by an invalid `signedData_` parameter are invalid, or not?


[09/01/2024 11:14] crisscsc

Hello Boys and girls could you tell me what is a purpose of using art.endTime in PjiFactory.sol contract?


[09/01/2024 18:38] avoloder
To tell for how long the minting of that art will be possible

instead of `bun install`


[09/02/2024 14:36] chonkov
What is the `protocolFeeDestination`? Is it a contract or just an EOA? What is the purpose of this function inside the `PhiFactory.sol` contract: ```
function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
  protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
}```


[09/02/2024 14:51] samuselderg
Started a thread.


[09/02/2024 17:34] chonkov
Can someone further explain this known issue: `6. Solady ECDSA.recover(), which does not reject malleable signature. For this issue, we use expiresIn`. Does it mean that it is fixed due to the use of `expiresIn` or I am misinterpreting it?


[09/03/2024 11:59] chonkov
What is supposed to be the difference between - `claim(...)/merkleClaim(...)` and `claim(...)/signatureClaim(...)` inside the `PhiFactory` contract?


[09/03/2024 12:32] izuman
They are different forms of verifying if a user is allowed to mint one is through a signature and the second is through a merkle tree proof


[09/03/2024 12:52] chonkov
Ok, but a user should be able to mint one through both using `claim()` and `merkleClaim()` right? It should be sort of a preference on they part


[09/03/2024 13:12] izuman
Depends on how the art was setup and if they uploaded a credMerkleRootHash otherwise they can use signatureClaim with a signed signature


[09/03/2024 13:34] chonkov
Ok, got it. Let‚Äôs say they use merkle roots for verification. The user should be able to claim their nft by either calling claim or merkleClaim and it shouldn‚Äôt make a difference right?


[09/03/2024 13:51] izuman
Correct you can claim through claim and merkleClaim

no there is nothing for wardens you need the SR role to escalate

Hi @thebrittfactor | C4 Is $0.19 cents correct for an upgraded to high severity? Apologies for having to ask.


[09/30/2024 13:08] thebrittfactor
H-05 was a 42 split, which unfortunately decreases the pot for that finding a fair bit. You should be able to review the [findings.csv](https://code4rena.com/community-resources/findings.csv) resource to see these breakdowns further.

[10/09/2024 06:35] kuprumion
I totally understand your frustration (I've been in this situation before), but I am afraid there is nothing you can do about it. The only way is to get the Security Researcher (SR) status, and then you can participate in the Post-Judging QA discussions, and let the judge know that you have a valid duplicate.

Hey colleagues, sorry to bother, but have you seen that all the protocol funds may be drained from the `Cred`'s balance as described with a PoC here https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/195 ? 
I don't see such a risk described in High risk findings selected for report here https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"3+%28High+Risk%29".

The issue https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/195 is marked as a duplicate to https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/25 (as I understand). However, I claim that this is a separate issue, since
a) mitigation presented in #25 won't help, just hinder an attacker's path a bit
b) impact of #195 is way more huge - entire protocol funds may be stolen, not just some rewards-in-flight
c) they do share some code path, but only in part

What do you think?
